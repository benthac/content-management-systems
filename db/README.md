# Employee Tracker

The purpose of this application is to create a functional employee
management system that allows for the adding of employees, the changing of employee roles, and the updating of employee roles as well.  The application should also be able to display all departments, and employees as well.

This is still a work in progress.  I had it working but i have broken the code while trying to get the function of the queries to work properly.  I intend to revisit this file but i need to submit it and focus in on the second group project.
